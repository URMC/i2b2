    <h2>Community Plug-ins - WORKBENCH</h2>

    <p>The i2b2 Workbench is a desktop client and the plug-ins contained here will only work in the i2b2 Workbench. Unlike Web Client and Server plug-ins the Workbench plug-ins are specific to the desktop in which they are installed. This means if you have the i2b2 Workbench installed on multiple computers you will need to install the plug-in on each of them.</p>

    <p>The plug-ins contained within this folder are developed for the i2b2 Workbench by members of the i2b2 Community.</p>
